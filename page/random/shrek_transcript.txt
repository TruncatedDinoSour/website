Shrek: "Once upon a time, there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle, guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from the dreadful prison, but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep, in the highest room of the tallest tower, for her true love and true love's first kiss." [Laughing] Like that's ever gonna happen.

Shrek in Armor: Yeah, right before they burst into flame!
Fiona: You know, that's not the point! Oh! Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.
Shrek in Armor: Well, I have to save my ass.
Fiona: What kind of knight are you?
Shrek in Armor: One of the kind.
Donkey: Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned. [Laughs] I don't to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally ready for a commitment of, uh, this-- Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude-- Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or maybe his pen pals. 'Cause I'm the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards, and-- I'd really love to stay, but-- Hey, hey, hey! Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal ail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission to-- Wait. What are you gonna do with that? Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no!

Fiona: And where would be a brave knight be without his noble steed?
Donkey: All right, I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She thinks I'm a noble steed.
Fiona: [Fiona Laughs] The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.
Shrek in Armor: Uh, no.
Fiona: Why not?
Shrek: I have helmet hair.
Fiona: Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.
Shrek in Armor: No, no, you wouldn't'st.
Fiona: But, how will you kiss me?
Shrek in Armor: What? That job wasn't in the job description.
Donkey: Maybe it's a perk.
Fiona: No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon, is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.
Donkey: Hmm? With Shrek? You think-- Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is your true love?
Fiona: Well, yes.
[Laughing]

Donkey: You think Shrek is your true love!
Fiona: What is so funny?
Shrek in Armor: Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?

Shrek in Amror: Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.
Fiona: Just take off the helmet.
Shrek in Amror: I'm not going to.
Fiona: Take it off.
Shrek in Amror: No!

Shrek in Armor: Okay! Easy. As you command, Your Highness.
Fiona: You-- You're-- an ogre.
Shrek: Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
Fiona: Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre.
Shrek: Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay. He's the one who wants to marry you.
Fiona: Then why didn't he come to rescue me?
Shrek: Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.
Fiona: But I have to be rescued by my true love. Not by some ogre and his pet.
Donkey: So much for noble steed.
Shrek: You're not making my job any easier.
Fiona: I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here.
Shrek: Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? I'm a delivery boy.
Fiona: You wouldn't dare. Put me down!
Shrek: Ya comin', Donkey?
Donkey: I'm right behind ya.
Fiona: Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down! [Screams]
Donkey: Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right? But you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten?
Fiona: You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your-- Hey! [Sighs] The sooner we get to Duloc the better.
Donkey: Oh, yeah. You're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!
Fiona: And my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?
Shrek: Well, let me put this way, Princess. Men of Farquaad's standards are in short supply. [Laughs]
Donkey: I don't know, Shrek. There are those who think little of him.
[Both Laughing]
Fiona: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
Shrek: Maybe. But I'll let you do the "measuring" when you see him tomorrow.
Fiona: Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
Shrek: No, that'll take longer.
Fiona: But there's robbers in the woods.
Donkey: Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camping definitely is startin' to sound good.
Shrek: Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.
Fiona: I need to find somewhere to camp now!
[Bird Wings Fluttering]
Shrek: [Grunting] Hey! Over here.
Donkey: Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess.
Fiona: No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.
Shrek: Homey touches? Like what?
[Crashing]
Fiona: A door. Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

Shrek: Over there. That's Throwback, the only ogre ever to spit over three wheat fields.
Donkey: Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?
Shrek: The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look. There's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for.
Donkey: I know you're making this up.
Shrek: No, look. There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.
Donkey: Man, ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.
Shrek: You know, Donkey, Sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
Donkey: [Sighs] Shrek. What we gonna do, when we get our swamp anyway?
Shrek: Our swamp?
Donkey: You know, when we're through with rescuing the princess.
Shrek: We? Donkey, there is no "we." There's no "our." There's just me and my swamp. The first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land.
Donkey: You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.
Shrek: No. Ya think?
Donkey: Are you hidin' something?
Shrek: Never mind, Donkey.
Donkey: This is another one of those onion things, isn't it?
Shrek: No, this is one of those drop-it-and-leave-it-alone things.
Donkey: Why don't you want to talk about it?
Shrek: Why do you always want to?
Donkey: Why are you blocking?
Shrek: I'm not blocking.
Donkey: Yes, you are.
Shrek: Donkey, I'm warning you.
Donkey: Who you trying to keep out?
Shrek: Everyone! Okay?
Donkey: Now we're getting somewhere.
Shrek: For the love of Pete!
Donkey: What exactly is your problem? What do you got against the world?
Shrek: I'm not the one with the problem. It's the world that seems to have a problem. People take one look at me and go, "Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly, ogre!" [Sighs] They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.
Donkey: You know? When we met, I didn't think you were just a big, stupid, ugly, ogre.
Shrek: Yeah.
Donkey: So, are there any Donkeys up there?
Shrek: There's Gabby, the Small and Annoying.
Donkey: Oh, yeah, I see him. The big, shiny one there. Right?

Shrek: Donkey!
Donkey: No!
Shrek: Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?
Donkey: Hmph.
Shrek: [Sighs] I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly, ogre. Can you forgive me?
Donkey: Hey, that's what friends are for. Right?
Shrek: Right. Friends?
Donkey: Friends.
Shrek: So, what did Fiona say about me?
Donkey: What are you asking me for? Why don't you ask her?
Shrek: The wedding! We'll never make it in time.
Donkey: Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way, and I have a way. [Whistles]
Shrek: Donkey?
[Donkey Laughing]
Donkey: I guess it's just an animal magnetism.
Shrek: [Laughing] Aw, come here, you.
Donkey: All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet. [Donkey Laughing] Whoo!
[Bells Tolling]
[All Gasping]
Bishop: People of Duloc, we gather here today, to bear witness, to the union...
Fiona: Um-- of our now king--
Bishop: Excuse me.
Fiona: Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?
Farquaad: [Chuckling] Go on.
Donkey: Go ahead, have some fun. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you?
Shrek: What are you talking about?
Donkey: There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"
Shrek: I don't have time for this!
Donkey: Wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you?
Shrek: Yes.
Donkey: You wanna hold her?
Shrek: Yes.
Donkey: Please her?
Shrek: Yes!
Donkey: ♪ Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. ♪ The chicks love that romantic crap!
Shrek: All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?
Donkey: We gotta check it out.
[Donkey Grunting]
Bishop: And so, by the power vested in me...
Shrek: What do you see?
Donkey: The whole town's in there.
Bishop: I now pronounce you husband and wife...
Donkey: They're at the altar.
Bishop: King and Queen.
Donkey: Mother Fletcher! He already said it.
Shrek: Oh! For the love of Pete!
[Grunts]
Shrek: I object!
Fiona: Shrek?
[Gasps]
Farquaad: Oh, now what does he want?
[Crowd Clamoring]
Shrek: Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.
Fiona: What are you doing here?
Farquaad: Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding--
Shrek: Fiona! I need to talk to you.
Fiona: Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me--
Shrek: But you can't marry him.
Fiona: And why not?
Shrek: Because-- Because he's just marrying you so he can be king.
Farquaad: Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
Shrek: He's not your true love.
Fiona: And what do you know about true love?
Shrek: Well, I-- Uh-- I mean--
Farquaad: Oh, this is precious. [Chuckling] The ogre has fallen in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord.
[Crowd Laughing]
Farquaad: An ogre and a princess! [Laughing Continues]
Fiona: Shrek? Is this true?
Farquaad: Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after." Now, kiss me! Mmmm!
Fiona: "By night one way, by day another." I wanted to show you before. (Fiona stepped back and
[Whimpers]
[Crowd Gasping]
Shrek: Well, uh, that explains a lot.
Farquaad: Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of my sight now! Get them! Get them both!
Fiona: No, no! Shrek!
Farquaad: This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king! See? See?
Fiona: No, let go of me, Shrek!
Shrek: No!
Farquaad: Don't just stand there, you morons.
Shrek: Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!
Farquaad: I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll beg for death to save you!
Fiona: No! Shrek!
Farquaad: And as for you, my wife,
Shrek: Fiona!
Farquaad: I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I am king!
[Whistles]
Farquaad: I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have-- Aaah! Aah!
Donkey: All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it.
[Dragon Roars]
Donkey: I'm a Donkey on the edge!
[Belches]
Donkey: [Donkey Laughs] Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?
[Cheering]
Donkey: Go ahead, Shrek.
Shrek: Uh, Fiona?
Fiona: Yes, Shrek?
Shrek: I-- I love you.
Fiona: Really?
Shrek: Really, really.
Fiona: I love you too.
All: Aawww!
Fiona: "Until you find true love's first kiss, and then take love's true form." [Echoing] [Echoing Continues] "Take love's true from. Take love's true form."
Shrek: Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?
Fiona: Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.
Shrek: But you are beautiful.
[Chuckles]
Donkey: I was hoping would be a happy ending.
