   <h2>
    Heads up
   </h2>
   <p>
    Just to warn you,
    <strong>
     this post is a bit bias
    </strong>
    , I personally prefer firefox, so my answer
will obviously be firefox, yes, firefox is not the king of privacy, but I still think
it's great, here's why.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Less bloated
   </h2>
   <p>
    Firefox is less heavy and less bloated, it's not as much of a resource, space
and in general firefox is more light and is smaller than chrome, chromium, etc.
it also takes less time to compile which matters to me a lot because I compile everything
from source, chromium takes ~60 times as much to compile as firefox and chromium is written
in C++ unlike firefox - in rust and rust is known to be slow at compiling so if firefox
switched back to C++ - firefox would be even faster to compile.
   </p>
   <p>
    Chromium also has a messier codebase so that also makes it prune to bugs and generally misshaps and stuff.
Firefox's LoC is 21 milion where chromium has 35.
   </p>
   <p>
    Firefox uses a less bloated, but less performant web engine - gecko, the efficiency is not
bad imo, but slower than blink, though as it's lighter - i prefer it.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Easier to harden
   </h2>
   <p>
    Firefox is easier to harden making it nice for people who are willing to spend
the time tinkering around with it nicer, chromium is a bit a pain in the ass
and as far as I see the most you can harden it easily is to install a few googled
addons and that's it where with firefox you can do a lot more. Firefox is great for
tinkerers and people who like customisation.
   </p>
   <h2>
    More customisable
   </h2>
   <p>
    Firefox allows for more customisation through
    <code>
     user.js
    </code>
    script (mainly for preferences) and
userChrome.css which is great again, for people who are willing to spend the time customising it.
I prefonally made firefox's interface minimalist with my userChrome and it's nice, where with
chromium I don't think I can do that AFAIK.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Chromium is targeting "tech normies"
   </h2>
   <p>
    Chromium and chrome are the most popular browsers out there, so they expect most people using
them to be "tech normies" (explained what they are in one of my blog posts), so they add all that
various abstraction and hiding making it hard for anyone to debug it.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Firefox has better debugging tools
   </h2>
   <p>
    As firefox is not as targeted to an average windows user who just wants to click buttons
they have good debugging tools, I mainly use it for debugging front-end, but their javascript
debugging is fine too.
