        <p>
            Recently I have been thinking a lot about switching to a minimalistic hardened gentoo system.
            Not that I want to get away "from the bloat" as my current system is quite light, but just to challenge
            myself and get a simpler, more secure operating system that is functional.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though I'm the type of person who loves extreme customisation, I want to know how light I can get
            my system and how secure I can get it, even though it might seem stupid to some people, It seems like
            a fun experience for me and in general pushing myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            So here is my plan:
        <ul>
            <li>X11 (xorg-server) as my display server</li>
            <li>DWM as my window manager</li>
            <li>OpenRC as my init system</li>
            <li>Hardened, no-multilib, openRC stage3 tarball</li>
            <li>Harsh USE flags to make software minimal</li>
            <li>None/little eye candy</li>
            <li>Less proprietary blobs</li>
            <li>Stronger encryption</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I will completely ditch everything I have customised probably, will make a completely
            fresh and minimal system, and hell, I might even like it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway currently deciding, I love my current setup, but I think it's a good thing to
            push yourself, anyway, If I decide to switch I will probably create a gentoo-minimal branch
            in my
            <a href="/dotfiles">
                dotfiles
            </a>
            so y'all will know if I decide to switch :)
        </p>
