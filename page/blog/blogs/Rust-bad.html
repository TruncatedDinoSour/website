      <h2>Rust is solving an issue nobody has</h2>
      <p>
        Ah yes, memory safety, the only thing people use bruhst for, like it's
        so important to them, first up if you're allocating a lot of memory you
        shouldn't be programming either way, allocating memory is slow and heavy
        so you should not do it if you can get away of not doing it, like ofc
        it's necessary to allocate memory in
        <strong> some cases </strong>
        , but to unnecessarily allocate it and FORGET TO FREE IT is just on
        you...
      </p>
      <h2>Rust is painful to compile</h2>
      <p>
        Rust is horribly heavy and slow to compile so if people start writing
        software only in rust it will become a mess for users who compile their
        software and it's already happening for me for example, I'm on gentoo
        and every time I compile rust I just want to kill myself because of how
        painful and slow it is. Just bad...
      </p>
      <h2>Less availability</h2>
      <p>
        Rust binaries are slower and larger so making the availability to people
        bad. And for people who have lower spec computers and they still compile
        everything this will also make the compiling process painful so they
        might give up and not use your software, again making your software less
        available to less people. Even though it can make the development builds
        faster, at the end it's the end user who's experience is more important.
      </p>
      <h2>Horrible ass syntax</h2>
      <p>
        Rust's syntax is horrible and not a lot of developers know it and not a
        lot of jobs require it, so learning rust is just torturing with the
        weird ass, shit(tm)++ syntax:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          fn~~~~~~~~~~~!@@!!!!! so(jauhg::sfduf!!!68768Jijuhe:;@@@@@@
          ufuheuwifh) { using
          s:s:e:frg::gger:fwuhf::jfewhe::fweuhwueih:::fiehu9wehf::fhuewhf:::fiuuwehf::fhuwehufhwe::ewiuhfwuie;
          kfhuerh::fiufu::yufewy:fwgiwfuif::owiffhoiwefh::fehuhyew::wfiuguifg::3hw8w
          &lt;&lt; "r23rj4r" &lt;&lt; 'wfefwhuwfhefhwe9fwhdhuhfweidu';;;;;;
          43twrugyj9ifj0fjfew(())))(()()()()()()()()()))()()()::g9hgergheeegu; }
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to exaggerate, but this actually feels and looks a bit like
        rust code LOL... Even though this also resembles C++ a bit, C++ is not
        as horrible as this.
      </p>
      <h2>Buggy</h2>
      <p>
        Even though rust has come a good way since like two years back it's
        still buggy and for production you can kinda expect it to break in one
        way or another.
      </p>
      <h2>In some ways, bad debugging experience</h2>
      <p>
        Disassembling rust binaries is a pain, so you lose some privilege to
        debugging rust code, though that's just my experience, complete mess...
      </p>
      <h2>Rust causes bloated software</h2>
      <p>
        Rust projects usually require 3908948093 crates, even the simplest
        projects require a lot of them so rust executables become large and
        painful to compile quick. Rust dependencies also are a pain to manage
        and you just get a LARGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE cargo.toml file so
        again making it a pain to download for people with worse hardware, shit
        internet and/or low storage.
      </p>
      <h2>Rust has a bad community</h2>
      <p>
        Rust's community consists of idiots calling C cringe, unsafe, slow and
        in general bad and people who complain about CMake causing C software to
        be bloated when it's nowhere near as bloated as cargo and in general
        rust. Sure they have good docs, but that's everything good about it...
      </p>
      <p>
        Every project includes at least one rocket emoji and description is
        something like "XXX is a blazingly fast, configurable, lightweight
        #rustrewrite, it introduces 69 new features and it's very very fast
        trust me"
      </p>
      <h2>More downsides than upsides</h2>
      <p>
        People call rust good because it's modern and has useless memory safety
        when overlooking other flaws I mentioned before for example being
        bloated, less available and being slow to compile, making rust
        ultimately useless
      </p>

      <i>Updated points</i>
      <hr />
      <h2>Bad library support</h2>
      <p>
        Even though rust has a bunch of libraries, it's missing a lot of them
        and doing everything from scratch is a pain. Its libraries suck a lot
        and most that are out there are buggy.
      </p>
      <h2>Bad IDE support</h2>
      <p>
        Rust with its popularity is getting more editing support, but either way
        on a bunch of editors rust is not supported as language.
      </p>
      <h2>Overly backed by companies</h2>
      <p>
        I don't like companies and they usually ruin everything,
        I see rust's future as a pile of garbage...
      </p>

      <hr />
      <p>
        Now, rust community, I know y'all don't like me, but please, I know
        you're reading this, explain to me why rust is so good, make an issue on
        github or something. I keep asking y'all and y'all just keep ignoring me
        which is kinda stupid when you are trying to prove a point.
      </p>
      <br/>

      <p>And some points y'all pointed out:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Ah yes, memory safety, such useless thing" (sarcasticly)</li>
        <li>"Bad syntax, lisp totally does it better"</li>
        <li>
          "Obviously we call rust good because of memory safety and modernism"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <i>tbh nothing else? fr?</i>

      <br/>
      <br/>

      <p>
        To debunk stuff y'all said. Memeory safety being useless is true imo,
        most projects are not some high scale enterprise apps which are stupidly
        made by allocating memory left and right and it being not closely
        monitored. and the ones which are lower-scale usually don't allocate a
        bunch of memory always and not free it, but if they do, just to make
        sure, memory safety is good. A lot of people seem to think that when
        programming in C you have to code like mallocing memory for everything
        all the time. And bad syntax, yes, its syntax is bad worse than C++, I
        can't believe how badly designed it is. And again, yes, you call it good
        because of those things while ignoring all the downsides of it, you just
        want to be "a part of a trend" and overly focused on modernism.
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p>
        Also to that one guy who said I'm a moron because I use gentoo,
        sure, at least I don't need 1662 crates for a hello world <3
