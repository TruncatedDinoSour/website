    I see SO MANY people asking basic things about linux like "how do I use apt?" or something
and they don't even look it up and when I tell them to "please look it up" or "google it" they
get offended and REFUSE to even google it, some of them are like "ew I don't use google" and
I literally don't give a shit what search engine you usually use and on the internet it's usually used
as "search it up".
   </p>
   <p>
    Some people also have the audacity to come to a help/support group of some distro
and claim that it's there so people would not need to google stuff.
Every time I see someone like them it's just annoying, I ask them to google it
and they just refuse...
   </p>
   <p>
    Please before asking for any support online search it up and even if you join
some help community -- don't be a leech, if people help you, please give back
to the community.
   </p>
   <p>
    Developing the skill to use search engines is important, being a support leech,
refusing to search it up and/or in general being lazy.
   </p>
   <p>
    And on the topic of "being lazy", this also relates to support, if you're giving support
to a person or you're the person who's accepting there is and should never be such thing as "being lazy".
If you're giving support for a person who just asked "how to i remove /home/trash?" you should not tell them
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     rm -rfvi /
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    And when they run it you just go "ughhhhh I'm so lazy to type /home/trash" or the opposite,
if you're accepting help and want clearification on something, for example "how do I install bat?"
and the person answers "sudo pacman -S bat" and you just say '
    <code>
     pacman s bat?
    </code>
    ' the person will ofc say no
and like 5 minutes later you say "ughhh I am lazy to type it whole", please be specific or something could
go wrong or you would waste someone's time.
