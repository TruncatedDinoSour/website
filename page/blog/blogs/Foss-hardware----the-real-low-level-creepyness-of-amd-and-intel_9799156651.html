    FOSS hardware should be a thing.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Intel ME and AMD PSP
   </h2>
   <p>
    Intel and AMD are pretty popular
    <strong>
     companies
    </strong>
    and so like most companies they're evil.
For example
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine">
     Intel ME
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Platform_Security_Processor">
     AMD PSP
    </a>
    ,
they're basically low-level spyware, and not like you can easily disable it.
Normal users won't be able to do it properly and even experienced computer nerds
too, it's really finicky and I only saw few people on the internet do it, well at least for Intel.
   </p>
   <p>
    As far as I'm aware for Intel CPUs you have to
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Patch the BIOS
    </li>
    <li>
     Patch the firmware
    </li>
    <li>
     Physically modify the CPU
    </li>
    <li>
     Configure the BIOS
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    And for AMD it's a bit easier
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Patch the firmware
    </li>
    <li>
     Patch the BIOS
    </li>
    <li>
     Configure the BIOS
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Both Intel ME and AMD PSP have LOADS of CVEs, the ironic thing is that
they're supposed to be secure...
   </p>
   <p>
    They are terrible, just built in CVEs and spyware, not even open source.
It's all proprietary... They use
    <a href="https://securitytrails.com/blog/security-through-obscurity">
     security through obscurity
    </a>
    which has never ended well...

   <h2>
    FOSS hardware
   </h2>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     What do I even mean by "FOSS hardware"?
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Open source firmware, drivers, BIOS, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
     All scheming and build process FOSS too.
    </li>
    <li>
     All plans completely open.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Etc.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     FOSS hardware.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Now after reading this you probably now understand why I want FOSS hardware.
There's no real alternatives to Intel and AMD spyware so we have to deal with it,
so FOSS hardware would
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Make FOSS more popular and give FOSS operating systems hardware they need
    </li>
    <li>
     Would not have as many CVEs and in general insecurities
    </li>
    <li>
     Would have less issues on for example BSD and Linux
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Like imagine having probably no issues on FOSS operating systems
and not needing to live in a world where EVERYTHING you do is spied on you
on a very low, hardware, level.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     In general FOSS
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    As I see Linux growing more and more I feel like the next
logical step is FOSS hardware, Linux lacks that a bit, it would be amazing to have something that
you can trust and see what it does on every level.
   </p>
   <hr/>
   <p>
    To conclude
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     AMD and Intel are weird and just as bad as any other companies
known for their spyware, just that Intel ME and AMD PSP is not
as talked about
    </p>
