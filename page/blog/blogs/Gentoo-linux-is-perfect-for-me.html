<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Gentoo has everything I need/want. it meets my requirements well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choice - you can get anything on the distro (Like a custom kernel, init system,</li>
<li>Lightweight - the distro is light, comes with barely anything</li>
<li>Manual installation - the installation process is manual</li>
<li>Customisable software - you can decide what features go into software you install</li>
<li>Source-based - the software I install should be compiled from source on my local system</li>
<li>Rolling release - the distribution has the most recent packages</li>
<li>Big repositories - the software repositories should be big enough for me to be able to use it</li>
<li>Good package manager - easy to configure, easy to add and create repos package manager</li>
</ul>
<p>Gentoo has them all except "big repositories", well it is usable by default - i still had to create my own custom overlay for a couple of packages, though GURU (basically gentoo's aur) has them all, so that's like 0.5 of a point.</p>
<p>Gentoo also has great forums and in general community so I personally love gentoo in a lot of ways.</p>
