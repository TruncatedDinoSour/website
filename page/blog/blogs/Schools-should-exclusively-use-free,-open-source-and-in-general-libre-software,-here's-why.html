            <hr/>

            <p>Today I met a student who is <strong>forced</strong> to use <a href="https://web.respondus.com/he/lockdownbrowser/">lockdown browser</a>,
            which made me kinda angry how schools are so dependant on closed source spyware. When y'all
            sign up for university or school y'all are not giving your basic right to security and privacy to them, but
            they're still basically giving your data to every proprietary garbage companies that are money hungry.</p>
            <p>I know this blog won't change schools from using proprietary software and all, but I hope that this
            at least makes little change and students could finally stop their data being mined unconsciously
            through the software and operating systems school use.</p>
            <p>This post might seem a bit ranty... because it kinda is a rant, so enjoy :).</p>
            <h2>FOSS software is free, thus saving money</h2>
            <p>Schools don't have an unlimited budget so using fully open source, libre software would
            save them thousands on stupid office and microsoft windows licenses.
            Even though FOSS software might take a bit to get used to for current students,
            if FOSS gets accepted in schools the next generation will be long used to FOSS tools, software and operating
            systems.</p>
            <h2>FOSS operating systems can restore old hardware</h2>
            <p>Linux (and other FOSS operating systems) are usually lighter than microsoft windows or apple's macOS,
            so it can bring old school's systems back to life by giving them another chance to work better.
            Linux being the more popular FOSS operating system will probably work better on school computers
            because of the better hardware, driver and software support than something like OpenBSD or serenity OS.</p>
            <h2>FOSS software and operating systems are more private</h2>
            <p>Administration at school managing your data are probably using microsoft windows and excel or word
            to manage your grades, phone numbers, addresses, names, etc. - for short personal data, but
            you probably did not consent to your schools basically giving away your personal data to microsoft for free,
            actually in any way, but in general - you did not consent for your data being exposed to a company.
            Schools should use FOSS software because of that alone, but also anything else that is happening at your
            school is being basically being given away to companies and if you for example have some mental issues,
            health problems, etc. you probably don't want companies having that data and then targeting you and
            as time passes knowing more about you than you know about yourself.</p>
            <h2>A lot more choice</h2>
            <p>Windows and macOS limits you to one option, but on linux for example you can let users pick their own desktop
            session, them to have their files isolated, better permissions, safer logins, etc. nobody could tinker or
            laugh at students because of their work or could mess it up or anything similar.
            They can also pick a distro depending of what they want, though they should remember that
            not all linux distros are FOSS, maintained and/or libre.</p>
            <h2>Better administration, security and permissions</h2>
            <p>The school cannot allow students to do anything they want, like removing the root system or in general
            getting root access, but for that linux has good permissions and in general good system management,
            you could even disable root access and only be able to access root with an SSH key or something.
            You can restrict people a lot from messing up anything, which is a good thing, sometimes. Also
            with linux you get a package manager, which means school computers will not get as infected with nasty malware.</p>
            <h2>Teaches students more about IT</h2>
            <p>You know how IT lessons now are close to useless and all students do in them is make microsoft word
            documents, paint images and excel spreadsheets? With linux students could learn system administration and
            management, server hosting, scripting and automation and programming,
            even though some IT lessons in schools are them learning programming, linux still is better supported
            in the programming world and with linux you get much more access to programming tools and programming languages.</p>
            <h2>Easy modification</h2>
            <p>If schools need a certain feature in the software they use, FOSS software is fully and easily modifiable,
            so schools can add the feature themselves or hire someone to do it for them and a good thing about FOSS
            software is that they cannot implant any spyware or spooky features without being noticed as FOSS software is
            usually released under the GPLv3 or at least under the GPLv2.1 license which says that people who modufy
            the software have to release it under the same FOSS license.</p>
            <h2>Freedom</h2>
            <p>Schools are usually restricted to what they teach just because they're using software that limits what to
            show and teach students.
            Schools could introduce what they're missing themselves and customise everything just how they like it and
            fully FOSS and libre
            from the desktop environment, the window manager to the kernel (see: <a href="https://www.fsfla.org/ikiwiki/selibre/linux-libre/">linux-libre</a> which keep in mind can also be hardened.)</p>
            <h2>Doesn't change much</h2>
            <p>Linux, BSD, etc; their distributions distributions, DEs and WMs don't change as much as windows or macOS so schools can
            be assured that they will get a constant and reliable experience, by that I mean the visuals don't change
            that much, but linux and stuff themselves get security updates and optimisation changes semi-often.</p>
            <h2>Updates</h2>
            <p>Even though updating is good, sometimes teachers after booting their computer will have a windows update
            for like 20 minutes and then they're not as able to teach students, with for example linux you pick when to update.
            The administration could teach teachers how to update their systems or just set up a cronjob and linux
            updates usually don't require an instant reboot, it can be easily upgraded in the background and you could
            easily just boot into the new kernel on the next boot.</p>
            <h2>Good documentation</h2>
            <p>Linux including other FOSS OSes are documented to great extents so if you face an issue you can easily figure out what's wrong and fix it,
            unlike on windows with its meaningless blue screens, so the administration could easily just fix
            the computers school has.</p>
            <h2>Linux and other FOSS OSes support a lot of devices</h2>
            <p>As linux (and FreeBSD, NetBSD, etc.) support a lot of devices and architectures schools could use phones, tablets and computers
            without needing to really change the software they use and so staying consistent and not ruining nor the
            teacher's nor the student's workflow,
            and they can run on other enterprise devices so sysadmins will also have a stable and consistent experience.</p>
            <hr />
            <p>Anyway, I know this was quite ranty, but sometimes I would love to make schools use FOSS and libre software,
            but I can't do anything beyond this heh, but anyway, have a nice day :).</p>
