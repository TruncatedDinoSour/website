    Even as a Linux user I can see some flaws in Linux design and the actions
the maintainers are taking, how corporate Linux is getting
and in general Linux itself.
   </p>
   <p>
    I like Linux, but I hate few things
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     I hate the corporate involvement
    </strong>
    , even though BSD people
are also getting funding from
    <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/28683/microsoft-funds-openbsd/">
     companies like Microsoft, google and Facebook
    </a>
    , Linux
is most definably more corporate with
    <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/linux-companies">
     over 300 companies funding
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://screen.pherpi.com/linux/how-many-companies-use-linux.html">
     over 1500 companies contributing to Linux
    </a>
    (
    <a href="https://enlyft.com/tech/products/linux">
     full report
    </a>
    )
compared to BSD with barely any corporate involvement (
    <a href="https://enlyft.com/tech/products/freebsd">
     full report
    </a>
    )
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     I hate how huge it is
    </strong>
    , Linux has
    <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/linux-in-2020-27-8-million-lines-of-code-in-the-kernel-1-3-million-in-systemd/">
     over 27 million lines of code
    </a>
    where
    <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/712308/">
     BSD has 32 million
    </a>
    , BSD might seem
bigger, but that is because Linux does not have to handle any coreutils and in general a bunch of extra stuff BSD has to deal with and BSD kernel images turn out to be times smaller than Linux (
    <a href="https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/is-is-freebsds-kernel-cleaner-and-smaller-than-linux.47173/">
     source
    </a>
    ) because the kernel itself is smaller than Linux if you did not count the extra stuff BSD has to deal with.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Linux... Is not secure?
    </strong>
    Linux is getting more popular, more malware and in general
Don't get me wrong, windows is way less secure but it's surprising how many
security issues Linux has... Just kinda sad to see, but you can harden it and
it gets noticed by people quite fast so it's kinda a 50/50?
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Linux is extremely painful to develop and features are just getting crammed
    </strong>
    ,
Linux being a huge kernel means that it is
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150214230010/http://codemonkey.org.uk/2014/11/03/thoughts-crashdumps/">
     horribly painful
    </a>
    to develop and debug, again, a very sad thing as a developer who one day maybe
potentially wants to contribute to Linux
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Linux ignores bugs
    </strong>
    even though our community is big and notices bugs quickly
Linux is centralised into few people who can merge and actually solve issues
related to Linux.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Linux has bad documentation
    </strong>
    , all said, just
    <a href="https://www.linuxtoday.com/blog/linux-bug-1-bad-documentation/">
     bad docs in software
    </a>
    adding on top of my pre-previous point in a way, but core kernel
seems well enough documented to "figure it out on your own", but what I can
say from personal experience that kernel panics are very useless and
very very hard to find anything about
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Linux is not backwards compatible
    </strong>
    as many people (including me) used (and some are) still thinking
Linux instead chooses to support long-dead used by nobody protocols, hardware and in general
bloating stuff that can be majorly deleted without causing any issues instead
on working on better
    <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=2379392&amp;cid=37090032">
     backwards
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=2820335&amp;cid=39847015">
     forwards
    </a>
    compatibility
   </p>
   <p>
    These are my "main" issues with Linux, I could have also included some points like
bad hardware support but BSD is not better at that either,
   </p>
   <p>
    So my goal for 2023 is switching to BSD full time, BSD has making bug steps in development in its OS (FreeBSD mainly) and it's looking better, but I am still quite
questioning about the tinkerability of BSD as I am the type of person who will go out
of their way to customise their kernel from the bottom up where I am not sure
if this is really advised in BSD, which sucks...
   </p>
   <p>
    So the conclusion is that Linux is the best worst OS...
   </p>
   <p>
    But this will not stop me from using Linux, it's an amazing OS, it does
not suck that much, most points I made might not make a huge difference for you
so don't doubt to try it :D even though
    <strong>
     I
    </strong>
    might not like
    <em>
     some
    </em>
    stuff about it
