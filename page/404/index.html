        <h1 class="title">HTTP/404 ~ not found</h1>

        <p>
            it was a beautiful day, and i decided to take a walk in the park, i
            had my phone with me, and i thought it would be a great idea to
            browse the internet while walking,
            <a href="#!">i clicked on a link</a>, and suddenly, i found myself
            lost !! the page i was looking for was not found, and i was stuck on
            an HTTP/404 error page :( i tried to refresh the page, but it didnt
            work, i felt lost and frustrated ...
        </p>

        <p>
            as i walked around, i realized that i was actually lost in the park
            ! i had no idea where i was and i had no way of finding my way back,
            i felt scared and alone, i wished i had paid more attention to my
            surroundings instead of being so engrossed in my phone ...
        </p>

        <p>
            i eventually found my <a href="/">way back</a>, but the experience
            left me feeling emotional and sad, it made me realize how much we
            rely on technology and how it can lead us astray :O from that day
            on, i promised myself to be more present in the moment and not let
            technology take over my life
