                NoVPN is a <a href="/" target="_blank">page on my website</a> to encourage people to not use VPNs if they don't have a use for them.

            <p>
                No. These VPNs collect enourmous ammount of your data and sell it.
                ExpressVPN <a href="//english.almayadeen.net/articles/analysis/exclusive:-expressvpn-insider-tells-all-on-companys-israelua" target="_blank">hires literal spies</a>
                and NordVPN had <a href="//blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/privacy/2021/03/21-million-free-vpn-users-data-exposed" target="_blank">a huge data breach</a>.
                These are just two examples, most proprietary VPNs are or have faced this sort of issue.

            <h1>But people, my friends and my favourite creators are telling me that my data will be exposed otherwise</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                That can technically happen, BUT, most sites use <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS" target="_blank">the HTTPS protocol</a> which
                is very secure and it's very unlikely your data will be exposed while visiting HTTPS sites.
                But if you use <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">only HTTP</a> which is not secure
                and someone is targeting you, yes they will get your data, but most HTTP sites are very simple and don't even give you
                the option to put in any details. And please remember that your favourite
                creators are paid to lie to you and they probably themselves don't know what they're saying so before you
                believe someone think to yourself "was there money involved" and "is there a chance that they actually know what they're talking about".
                Don't trust anyone.

            <br>
            <p>
                VPNs without a use... well are just useless... Don't use a VPN if you don't have a use.
                Because:

                <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>It slows down your connection</li>
                    <li>You're trusting someone else with your data</li>
                    <li>If you're using only a free trial - you're also wasting money</li>
                    <li>It gives you a <a href="//www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/false%20sense%20of%20security" target="_blank">false sense of security</a></li>
                    <li>It <a href="//tech.co/vpn/are-vpns-legal" target="_blank">could be illegal in your country</a></li>
                </ul>

                <br>

                Please think about if you <b>REALLY</b> need a VPN or are you just getting it
                just to waste money, bandwidth and your privacy...
